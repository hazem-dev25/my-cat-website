My first HTML project for learning 
# 🐱 My Cat Website

This is a beginner-level HTML project where I created a fun and simple website for selling my cat.  
The project includes:

- A user form (username, password, email)
- Cat pictures and categories
- Radio buttons to select cat colors
- A video and audio section
- A dropdown menu to choose a cat
- A feedback form

## 🔧 Tech used

- HTML5  
- Basic inline CSS (more styling coming soon!)

## 💡 Notes

This is my first web project while learning frontend development.  
I'll keep improving it as I learn more (like CSS and JavaScript).

## 📸 Screenshot (Coming soon)

I'll upload a screenshot of the project when I add more styling.

## 🚀 How to view the project

Just open `index.html` in any web browser (Chrome is recommended).
